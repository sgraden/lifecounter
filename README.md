UW INFO 498 Android Life Counter project

This project is intended to be used by those who play games, such as Magic the Gathering, that have health points each player needs to keep track of.

This allows between 2-8 players and each player has a counter. The counters increment and decrement by 1 and 5. When a user reaches 0 points, their name changes to acknowledge their loss. They are able to come back supposing the game allows it.
